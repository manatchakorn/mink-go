# mink-go
The Golang Full-Stack Framework. Mink-Go helps you build a microservice system in a minute. 

Goal:
- Manage full stack web application by config file
- Mink-Go will create test file for you and generate a basic template for testing.
- Built-in command line interface to manage system
- Follow Golang Clean Code Practice code structure from https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch
- Create plugable microservice with the command line interface (mink create service <name>)
- and more ... (think later)
